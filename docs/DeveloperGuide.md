## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`InternshipMainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/InternshipMainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `Internship{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `InternshipLogic` component defines its API in the `InternshipLogic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `InternshipLogicManager.java` class which follows the `InternshipLogic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `InternshipMainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternshipListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `InternshipMainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Internship` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`InternshipLogic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/InternshipLogic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `InternshipLogic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `InternshipBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in an `InternshipCommand` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `InternshipLogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `InternshipModel` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an internship).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternshipBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CreateCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CreateCommand`) which the `InternshipBookParser` returns back as a `InternshipCommand` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CreateCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `InternshipModel` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Internship` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueInternshipList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Internship` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Internship>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `InternshipModel` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### InternshipStorage component

**API** : [`InternshipStorage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/InternshipStorage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `InternshipStorage` component,
* can save both Flagship data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InternshipBookStorage` and `InternshipUserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `InternshipModel` component (because the `InternshipStorage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `InternshipModel`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create command

#### Implementation

The create command is facilitated by `InternshipLogicManager`. User input is first parsed by `InternshipBookParser#parseCommand()` and checked if it is a `create` command with a valid format.
Upon successful verification, the `create` command is executed.

The create command is exposed in the `InternshipModel` interface as `InternshipModel#createInternship`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the create command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `create c/Google ro/SWE a/Yet to apply de/25/12/2022 s/20/01/2023 du/3`
and it is parsed by `InternshipBookParser` to verify that it has the valid format of a `create` command.

<puml src="diagrams/CreateCommandParse.puml" alt="CreateCommandParse" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the command does not follow the valid format of a `create` command, a ParseException will be thrown if the
command does not correspond to any possible command formats, and we will not proceed to step 2. If it corresponds to the
format of another valid command (that is not `create`), subsequent execution in step 2 will follow the logic flow of
the other corresponding command.

</box>

Step 2. The `create` command is executed. If there does not exist a duplicate entry in `InternshipStorage`, the internship
entry is created successfully.

<puml src="diagrams/CreateCommandExecute.puml" alt="CreateCommandExecute" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If there exists a duplicate entry, a CommandException will be thrown, and we will not proceed to step 3.

</box>

Step 3. The internship entry is stored in `InternshipStorage`.

<puml src="diagrams/CreateCommandStore.puml" alt="CreateCommandStore" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the create command operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/CreateSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="CreateSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `CreateCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: What constitutes a duplicate internship entry:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Identical `COMPANY_NAME` and `ROLE` (insensitive to initial letter capitalisation of each distinct word) is individually sufficient
    * Pros: Easy to manage and debug
    * Cons: Does not label duplicates in the strict equality sense

* **Alternative 2:** Case-sensitive, identical attributes across all fields are necessary for an entry to be classified a duplicate
    * Pros: Label duplicates in the strictest possible sense
    * Cons: Most accidental duplicate entries mistakenly entered by the user need not resemble one another completely across all attributes.

### Delete command

#### Implementation

The delete command is facilitated by `InternshipLogicManager`. User input is first parsed by `InternshipBookParser#parseCommand()` and checked if it is a `delete` command with a valid format.
Upon successful verification, the `delete` command is executed.

The delete command is exposed in the `InternshipModel` interface as `InternshipModel#deleteInternship`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the create command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs `delete 1`
and it is parsed by `InternshipBookParser` to verify that it has the valid format of a `delete` command.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandParse.puml" alt="DeleteCommandParse" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the command does not follow the valid format of a `delete` command, a ParseException will be thrown if the
command does not correspond to any possible command formats, and we will not proceed to step 2. If it corresponds to the
format of another valid command (that is not `delete`), subsequent execution in step 2 will follow the logic flow of
the other corresponding command.

</box>

Step 2. The `delete` command is executed. If the index is valid, when it is greater than 0 and an internship exists at the specified index,
the specified internship is selected for deletion.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandExecute.puml" alt="DeleteCommandExecute" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the index of the delete command is invalid, a CommandException will be thrown, and we will not proceed to step 3.

</box>

Step 3. The selected internship entry is deleted.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandRemove.puml" alt="DeleteCommandRemove" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

### Sort feature

### Sort Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by InternshipBook. InternshipBook provides us with the field of currentComparator, which stores the current sorting order of the lists. Additionally, it provides the main sort operation:

- `UniqueInternshipList#sortInternships(comparator)` — Sorts the current internship list using the comparator.
- `InternshipModelManager#updateSortComparator(comparator)` — Updates currentComparator to save the most recent sorted order.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The currentComparator takes on a default value of BY_COMPANY_NAME. The command `sort default` is equivalent to `sort co/ASC`.

</box>

The `UniqueInternshipList#sortInternships(comparator)` is called from the `InternshipModelManager#sortInternships(comparator)` method.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and already has a bunch of internships listed. The currentComparator is in its default value.

<puml src="diagrams/SortCommandState0.puml" alt="SortCommandState0" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** This diagram shows the high level diagram with the intermediate layers hidden. It is meant to show the order of the internships within the list.

</box>

Step 2. The user inputs `sort ro/ASC` (in the format of [CATEGORY]/[ASC/DESC]) and it is parsed by `InternshipBookParser` to verify that it has the valid format of a `sort` command.

<puml src="diagrams/SortCommandParse.puml" alt="SortCommandParse" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the command does not follow the valid format of a `sort` command, a ParseException will be thrown if the
command does not correspond to any possible command formats, and we will not proceed to step 3. If it corresponds to the
format of another valid command (that is not `sort`), subsequent execution in step 3 will follow the logic flow of
the other corresponding command.

</box>

Step 3. The `sort` command is executed. The currentComparator field in InternshipBook is updated and `UniqueInternshipList#sortInternships(comparator)` is called.

<puml src="diagrams/SortCommandState1.puml" alt="SortCommandState1" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Once the currentComparator field is updated, any other operations on InternshipBook that edits the internship list will also call the `UniqueInternshipList#sortInternships(comparator)` command and sort the internship list after the update.
This diagram shows the high level diagram with the intermediate layers hidden. It is meant to show the order of the internships within the list.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortSequenceDiagram" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How we retain the sort order:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Keep track of the sorting and sort after every change made to internship book.
    * Pros: Ensures the internship list remains sorted after modifications.
    * Cons: Increases time complexity of operations.

* **Alternative 2:** Ignore the current sorted order after a change is made
    * Pros: Will reduce the complexity of operations as operations do not need to sort after making changes to the internship list.
    * Cons: Will cause the updated list to be no longer sorted.

### Filter feature

### Filter Implementation

The `filter` command is facilitated by  `InternshipLogicManager`. User input is first parsed by `InternshipBookParser#parseCommand()` and checked if it is a filter command with a valid format. Once the format is validated, the predicate required to filter the internships based on user criteria is generated.

This predicate is then used to update the filtered internship list in the `InternshipModel`. The filtered list will only contain internships that satisfy the conditions specified by the user.

The filter command is exposed in the InternshipModel interface as `InternshipModel#updateFilteredInternshipList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and already has a bunch of internships listed.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterCommandState0.puml" alt="FilterCommandState0" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** This diagram shows the high level diagram with the intermediate layers hidden. It is meant to show the order of the internships within the list.

</box>

Step 2.The user inputs `filter [CATEGORY_TYPE1]/[KEYWORDS]` for categories accepting text inputs such as `COMPANY_NAME`, `ROLE`, `APPLICATION_STATUS`, `REQUIREMENT`, and it is parsed by `InternshipBookParser` to verify that it has the valid format of a `filter` command.

Step 2.The user inputs `filter [CATEGORY_TYPE2]]/[START_END]` for categories accepting ranges such as start date, duration, and deadline, and it is parsed by `InternshipBookParser` to verify that it has the valid format of a `filter` command.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterCommandParse.puml" alt="FilterCommandParse" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the command does not follow the valid format of a `filter` command, a ParseException will be thrown if the
command does not correspond to any possible command formats, and we will not proceed to step 3. If it corresponds to the
format of another valid command (that is not `filter`), subsequent execution in step 3 will follow the logic flow of
the other corresponding command.

</box>

Step 3. The `filter` command is executed. The predicate generated based on user criteria is used to filter internships in the `InternshipModel`.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterCommandExecute.puml" alt="FilterCommandExecute" />
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The filtered list in the `InternshipModel` is updated to only include internships that satisfy the conditions specified by the predicate.

</box>

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How the filter conditions are specified:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a predicate-based approach to allow flexible filtering criteria.
    * Pros: Allows a dynamic and flexible way to filter internships based on various criteria.
    * Cons: Might be more complex than a simpler, fixed-criteria approach.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a fixed set of filter criteria.
    * Pros: Simpler to implement.
    * Cons: Less flexible and might not cover all use cases or user needs.

### Modify feature

### Modify Implementation

The `modify` command is facilitated through the `InternshipLogicManager`. Upon user input, it first goes through parsing by the `InternshipBookParser#parseCommand()`. This is to ensure that the input is indeed a `modify` command and that it adheres to a valid format.

Once it is verified as a legitimate command, the `modify` function is initiated. An essential part of this process is checking the new internship entry's `COMPANY_NAME` and `ROLE` against potential duplicates in the current `InternshipStorage` database. Notably, while doing this check, the original internship entry's `COMPANY_NAME` and `ROLE` are ignored. If no duplicate is identified, the internship entry is edited and then stored within `InternshipStorage`.

Developers can access the modify command through the `InternshipModel` interface via the `InternshipModel#modifyInternship` function.

Below is an example that demonstrates the modify command's behavior step-by-step:

Step 1: A user provides the command `modify 1 c/Jane Street ro/Coffee maker a/Yet to apply de/25/12/2022 s/20/01/2023 du/3 re/C++ re/Coffee`. This command is parsed by `InternshipBookParser` to validate if it is structured correctly for a `modify` command.

<puml src="diagrams/ModifyCommandParse.puml" alt="ModifyCommandParse" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** In cases where the command doesn't adhere to the valid `modify` command format, a `ParseException` gets triggered. If the command doesn't fit any recognized command patterns, we don't transition to step 2. However, if it does match another valid command format (other than `modify`), the logic for that other command is then executed in step 2.

</box>

Step 2: Post validation, the `modify` command is executed. If no duplicate entry exists in `InternshipStorage`, the editing of the internship entry goes through successfully.

<puml src="diagrams/ModifyCommandExecute.puml" alt="ModifyCommandExecute" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** When a duplicate entry is detected, a `CommandException` is raised, preventing progression to step 3.

</box>

Step 3: After successful editing, the internship entry is saved into `InternshipStorage`.

<puml src="diagrams/ModifyCommandStore.puml" alt="ModifyCommandStore" />

The following sequence diagram shows how the modify operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/ModifySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ModifySequenceDiagram" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How should we handle fields that aren't provided in the command?**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only modify the fields specified in the command, while retaining the original values of other fields.
    * Pros: Enables us to fetch the original internship data and modify only the intended fields without rebuilding the entire internship entry.
    * Cons: Retrieving the original internship entry might introduce extra complexity to the codebase.

* **Alternative 2:** Replace the entire internship entry with the index and details given in the command.
    * Pros: Simplifies the process as it can reuse code from both delete and create commands.
    * Cons: The command must encompass all required fields, even if the modification pertains only to a single field or a minor typo.
